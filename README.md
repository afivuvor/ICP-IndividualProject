# ICP-IndividualProject

Run project from Main.java.

Most of the work is being done in the main class. The class reads from the csv files and does the processing of information read from the files. The main method in the main class reads input from the input file and writes output into the output file.

To test run the code, create a text file with the source location in the form <city, country> on the first line and destination in the same format on the second line. 

The file was not cleaned so care should be taken in choosing locations for the test runs. Please do not use <city, country> pairs that have airports with commas should be avoided. The code does not satisfy such searches. 
  
Tests should be run using <city, country> pairs that are in airports.csv and have routes in routes.csv. Preferrably, major cities should be used for the test run.
  
Preferably, the test can be run using any of the input files attached (i.e.txt files) and the output will be a new file ending with a <filename>_output.txt.

Thank you :)

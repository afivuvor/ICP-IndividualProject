# ICP-IndividualProject

Most of the work is being done in the main class. The class reads from the csv files and does the processing of information read from the files. The main method in the main class reads input from the input file and writes output into the output file.

To test run the code, create a text file with the source location in the form <city, country> on the first line and destination in the same format on the second line. 
Alternatively, the test can be run using any of the input files attached (i.e.txt files) and the output will be a new file ending with a <filename>_output.txt.

The file was not cleaned so care should be taking in choosing locations for the test runs. Test running with a source city or destination city that has commas would most likely result in an error.

Thank you :)
